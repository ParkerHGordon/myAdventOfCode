/* my idea is to have an array that holds arrays with the houses' coordinates in them. I just need a x and a y for the north/south and east/west I think.

ex. ^ : housesVisited[[0,0][0,1]].
wait, how am I going to know if there's more of the same?
will I have to check every house every time? I guess so, but how?
use a for loop to check every one with length I suppose
yeah, that will work I think
